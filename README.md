# Machine Learning Quickstart

This guide is intended to quickly introduce common machine learning concepts and
workflows, with a focus on interactive examples and problem solving.

To start, go to the `exercises` folder and open one of the notebooks. You can
click the "Open in Colab" button at the top to start editing in an online
environment, or you can download this repo and edit them locally if you prefer.
Each exercise has a corresponding notebook in the `solutions` folder which can
be used as a reference if you get stuck or want to review later.
